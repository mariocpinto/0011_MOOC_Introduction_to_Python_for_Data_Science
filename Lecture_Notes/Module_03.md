### Module 3: Functions and Packages

* [Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vK688Es_Sk)
  * Introduction to Python functions - invocation and passing parameters.

* [Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQj6AcaYNSY)
  * Methods in Python as functions defined on specific object types.

* [Packages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS0GJMSSHKY)
  * Packages: Directory of python scripts. Each script is called a module.
  * Popular data science packages:
    * Numpy: to work efficiently with arrays
    * Matplotlib: for data visualization
    * Scikit-learn: for machine learning
  * Instructions on installing and importing packages.
  * Using functions from packages: e.g. `import numpy` or `import numpy as np` or `from numpy import array`. 
    The first two require _packagename_._function_ usage, but for the third the function name can be used directly.
